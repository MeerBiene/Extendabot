# Simple Feedback Plugin

Yeah the name gives it I guess. Simple Feedback Plugin. Registers a "feedback" command for your members to give feedback at any time

# Cmds:
> `feedback`

# Config:

The config is located inthe /data directory. Change the messages that are sent to the user in here. I recommend you to just place in a channel ID for the feedback and testing the plugin first, so you see, which message correlates to what user prompt.

### Note:

> Edit the config.json with something like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code, to ensure your json is formatted properly. Otherwise you can also use online [JSON Validator](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/).
