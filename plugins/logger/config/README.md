# Simple Logger:

### This is a simple Logger Plugin that offers some basic logging functionality. I madethis plugin mainly to show how to work with events.

# Config:

```js
{
    "logging-enabled": "true",  // this is the global plugin enabled setting. change this to true if you want to disable the plugin
    "message logging": "true",  // message logging: log deleted and updated messages
    "member-logging": "true",  // log member join/leaves and account updates like username/nickname/avatarchange
    "guild/role-logging": "true",  // log changes that are made to roles and the serer


    "loggingchannel": "711566222365294682"  // put the ID of the loggingchannel here. ID! not name not category, the channel ID! You have to have discord developer portal enabled , then simply rightclick the channel you want to use and place the ID in here. 

}
```
